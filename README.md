# HRM_PowerBI_Data_Project
In this project we build a HR Analytics dashboard which comprises of slicers on each page for filtering by Department to address the gender imbalance and diversity ratio issues in each department of the organization. Second page of the Viz displays all the Employee details with the help of a slicer such as Name, Department, Marital status, State of residence, Employment status, Manager name, Performance score. This dashboard was made with a dark background overall by choice and can be customized according to organization standards.
(You need an organization's Power BI account to access this)
